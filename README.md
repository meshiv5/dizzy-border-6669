## What is TimeCamp

TimeCamp is software which monitors the actions performed on the computer and helps employees better understand how they make use of their working time so that they can work more efficiently.

TimeCamp also allows us to carefully calculate the overtime and handle a list of presence in the company, as well as to control the time spent at the computer â€“ particularly on the Internet.

## How does TimeCamp work?

It is a small application installed on your computer. It collects information on the actively used apps and visited websites. Then, every 5 minutes, the program sends the data to a server, where, after login in, we have access to a dozen prepared reports concerning the time spent at the computer.

In the case when several applications are open, TimeCamp detects that the program which is currently in use. We measure only what the user actually does, not all the applications that are open.
